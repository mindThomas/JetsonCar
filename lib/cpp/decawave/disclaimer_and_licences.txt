(2)	Decawave Software is provided in two ways as follows: -
   (a)	pre-loaded onto the Module at time of manufacture by Decawave (“Firmware”);
   (b)	supplied separately by Decawave (“Software Bundle”).

(3)	Decawave Software consists of the following components (a) to (d) inclusive:

   (a)	The Decawave Positioning and Networking Stack (“PANS”), available as a library accompanied by source code that allows a level of user customisation.  The PANS software is pre-installed and runs on the Module as supplied, and enables mobile “tags”, fixed “anchors” and “gateways” that together deliver the DWM1001 Two-Way-Ranging Real Time Location System (“DRTLS”) Network.
 
   (b)	The Decawave DRTLS Manager which is an Android™ application for configuration of DRTLS nodes (nodes based on the Module) over Bluetooth™.

   (c)	The Decawave DRTLS Gateway Application which supplies a gateway function (on a Raspberry Pi ®) routing DRTLS location and sensor data traffic onto an IP based network (e.g. LAN), and consists of the following components:
      •	DRTLS Gateway Linux Kernel Module
      •	DRTLS Gateway Daemon
	  •	DRTLS Gateway Proxy
      •	DRTLS Gateway MQTT Broker
      •	DRTLS Gateway Web Manager 

   (d)	Example Host API functions, also designed to run on a Raspberry Pi, which show how to drive the Module from an external host microprocessor.

(4)	The following third party components are used by Decawave Software and are incorporated in the Firmware or included in the Software Bundle as the case may be: -

   (a)	The PANS software incorporates the Nordic SoftDevice S132-SD-v3 version 3.0.0 (production) which is included in the Firmware and is also included in the Software Bundle; 

   (b)	The PANS software uses the eCos RTOS which is included in the Software Bundle.  The eCos RTOS is provided under the terms of an open source licence which may be found at: http://ecos.sourceware.org/license-overview.html;
